## 🐍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

### 🔹 Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using `pandas`.  
2. **Initial Exploration:**  
   - Used `df.info()` to understand data structure  
   - Used `df.describe()` for statistical summary  
3. **Missing Data Handling:**  
   - Imputed missing values in `Review Rating` column using **median rating per product category**.  
4. **Column Standardization:**  
   - Renamed columns to `snake_case` for readability.  
5. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created `age_group` by binning customer ages.  
   - Created `purchase_frequency_days` from timestamp data.  
6. **Data Consistency Check:**  
   - Verified redundancy between `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used`; dropped the latter.  
7. **Database Integration:**  
   - Connected Python script to **PostgreSQL** and uploaded the cleaned dataset.
